# Welcome to my website!

Hi, my name is Mohammad Iqbal Surya Ramadhan 210411100002, and welcome to my personal website! Here, I use it as a documentation of assignments or projects from class A Digital Image Processing.

I enjoy studying Digital Image Processing courses and sharing what I learn with readers. Every article on this blog is made with the hope of providing benefits and inspiration to anyone who reads it.
